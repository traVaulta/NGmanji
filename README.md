# NGmanji - Rules of the game

The point of the game is to reach the end of the route (board) first.
On the way a set of challenges will appear in form of questions regarding Angular.
If successful the player continues, otherwise loses one (1) life out of three (3) available.
A player that loses all lives is out of the game.

The game is played in turns, so each player takes a turn to throw a single die.
The result of the die is the number of steps the player moves on the board.
If the player stops at any of the fields with a challenge stamp, the player must accept the challenge.
Challenges are done by picking a frst available question from the pile of questions on the board.
The player reads it and has to answer it. Failing to answer it will lead to a loss of life, like mentioned above.
It's game over once any player reaches the end. Note, that a player must get the correct result from die to reach it, otherwise skips skips the turn.

And remember,

_"In jungle you must wait, until the dice read five or eight..."_
